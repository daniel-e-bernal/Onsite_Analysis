This file is to include the type of data that you'll get from the Sitelist csv file.

Below we will tell you the column names that you will use.

  Site Identifier = "MatchID"
  Area or land available = "wind_ground_area"
  #this is in meters squared
  Latitude = "parcel_latitude"
  Longitude = "parcel_longitude"
  Wind exclusion = "wind_exclusion" #this is boolean (TRUE or FALSE)
Those may be all of the columns that you should be interested in.
